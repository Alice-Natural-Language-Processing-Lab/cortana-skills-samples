# AdaptiveCardSkillV4

This is a port of the V3 example to V4.  It is "done", but polish remains that means
1/ add appropriate MS headers
2/ scrub any ids/passwords
3/ change the namespace from the cloned EchoBot template to something specific to AdaptiveCards

Also, the _same_ port needs to happen on the JS side.

The biggest hurdle in the port is adding storage (required to be stateless).
